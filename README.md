## Overview
Welcome to the Quantum SchrÃ¶dinger Equation Solver repository, where we explore the fascinating world of quantum mechanics through computational methods. This repository hosts a GUI Python implementation for solving the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation, a fundamental quantum mechanics equation describing quantum systems' behavior.


## Features
- **CustomTkinter GUI:** The application employs CustomTkinter, a customized version of the Tkinter library, to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Visualization of Probability Densities:** Visualize the probability densities of the quantum system at different time steps, providing insights into the spatial distribution of the quantum states.
- **Visualization of Energy Levels:** Plot the energy levels of the quantum system, allowing users to analyze the discrete energy states and understand the quantum spectrum.
- **Customization:** Easily customize the solver parameters, such as grid resolution, potential energy function, and boundary conditions, to tailor the solution to specific quantum systems of interest.


## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- All the libraries included in requirements.txt


You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
## Download through Git:
1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On Windows, you can use the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On macOS or Linux, use the Terminal.

2. **Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UltraDeveloper7/QuantumSolver.git
   ```
4. **Navigate into the Cloned Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd QuantumSolver
   ```
Now, you have successfully cloned the repository to your local machine. You can proceed with the next steps, such as installing dependencies and running the application.

## Download through ZIP file:
1. Download the project as a zip file. You can do this by clicking on the "Code" button on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/UltraDeveloper7/QuantumSolver) and selecting "Download ZIP."
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted directory.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/extracted/folder
   ```
4. Run inside that folder the following command:
   ```bash
   python GUI.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python GUI.py
    ```
2. Use the graphical interface to select  which tab you want to go and then follow the instructions on the top of each tab.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues with the run-time of the program ensure you have Python 3.9 or later, since the program is being using multi-threading.
